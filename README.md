# gitemoji
A script that adds random emojis to git commit messages.


Commit messages are serious, too serious.  Spice things up with random emojis at the end of a message.  
* Install this gist:
* Download the file and toss it in /usr/local/bin.  Rename it to funcommit or fc (if you wanna stay productive)
* Change the file permissions so you can execute this bad boy. chmod u-x <name>
Give it a spin.

ex usage (after making some code changes)
	```fc "Fixed the crazy infinite loop, that was crashing all the servers"  (This is a sad and serious message)```

Now on github you will see: "Fixed the crazy infinite loop, that was crashing all the servers :eyeglasses: :three:"
